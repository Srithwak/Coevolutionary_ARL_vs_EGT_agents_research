Results- profitability
•	This is just one of the data sets we tested, but everyone of them had the same correlation.
•	The ARL agent achieved ~0.7% total return. The rolling reward plot shows the agent initially struggling (exploration) before converging to a stable, positive-reward policy.
•	Although in other data sets there were times when it lost money, it made a profit at the end.
•	The AI learned how to make money. It started knowing nothing, made mistakes, learned from them via gradient descent, and ended up profitable.

Results- Causality
•	Without the agent, the market remains chaotic, allowing Aggressive and Momentum traders to naturally dominate the ecosystem.
•	The ARL agent transformed the market, "starving" aggressive strategies by widening spreads until Passive traders took over >99% of the population.
•	Since the Market Data was identical for both runs, the drastic shift to a stable, passive market was caused entirely by the AI's strategic adaptation.
•	In between changes in population proportions, the random population seemed to take over, but that’s only because the AI agent can’t really affect the random population properly.
•	The Dependency Plot confirms the AI and population are mathematically coupled, proving the AI acted as an evolutionary filter rather than a passive observer.

Results- Strategy
•	The top image shows that the AI tried different spread widths before deciding on one to make profit.
•	The gray line is how often the agent acts to learn/explore. At first, its closer to 1, but as time passes it gets to 0, showing that its not acting randomly, but on what it has learnt.
•	When the spikes are small, the price gap in bid/ask spread is tight, which attracts traders. When spikes are big, the spread is wide, and it is repelling traders. 
•	There are big spikes when there is a crash in the market, showing that the agent is actively trying to stop itself from being exploited.

Results- Methodology
•	The histogram shows that the AI isn’t lucky, it consistently made small wins which added up over time.
•	The graph shows the agent dipping and then returning to 0 (the flat line). This demonstrates resilience—when the agent made a mistake or the market turned against it, it adapted its policy to recover the loss rather than "tilting" and losing more.
•	The bright center line proves the agent learned to keep its inventory near zero, validating that it understands risk management. It makes money by trading flow, not by taking dangerous bets on the direction of the stock.
